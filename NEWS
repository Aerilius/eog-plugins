Version 2.27.91
---------------

This is the first tarball release of eog-plugins. It's a collection of plugins
for use with the Eye of GNOME Image Viewer.

New Plugins:

- Map
  Provides a map view in the sidebar showing you where the current picture was
  taken if it carries the neccessary GPS tags. Written by Pierre-Luc Beaudoin.
  Requires libchamplain 0.3 and Clutter 1.0.

- Exif Display
  Adds a page displaying a few selected Exif tags to the sidebar. It's also
  possible to display a RGB histogram. Written by Emmanuel Touzery and extended
  by Jonathan Michalon.

- Zoom to fit image width
  Adds a menu entry that adjusts the zoom factor so the image's width fits into
  the window. Written by Javier Sánchez.

- Postr
  Allows uploading images to Flickr using Postr. It's the oldest plugin and we
  actually don't know if it is of use anymore as there are better ways to do
  that now. Written by Lucas Rocha.

- Python Console
  A port of the gedit plugin with the same name. Written in Python.
  Ported by Diego Escalante Urrelo and Francisco Rojas.

- Slideshow Shuffle
  The second plugin written in Python. It randomizes the image order during
  slideshows. Written by Johannes Marbach.
